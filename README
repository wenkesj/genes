genes
=====
Gene predictor and coding potential calculator. It comes with MT
transcripts and chromosome for the Human genome.

This algorithm uses a simple strategy: find all longest possible ORFs of
a given length threshold and then assigns a coding potential based on the usage
of all possible triplets from the alphabet {A,C,T,G} corresponding to the
codon usage table for human MT. The coding potential is a product of
probabilities of finding possible codons for the given threshold.

This project also includes an API friendly in which the user can change the
parameters of the coding profiling to a specific list codons to get higher
coding potential scores.


Easiest Way to Get Started
--------------------------
+ Download human chromosome MT
+ Download all the transcripts that you want to use (FASTA files) and put them
  in a directory.
+ Download and install https://golang.org/doc/install
+ Install the CLI for this project, run this from the command-line.
  $ go get github.com/wenkesj/genes


Running the Program:
--------------------
If you have installed golang correctly, `genes` should be located in your
systems $PATH. And you can run the defaults:
  $ genes -transcripts=./transcripts \
      -genome=./genomes/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.MT.fa \
      -orflengths=100,2000
